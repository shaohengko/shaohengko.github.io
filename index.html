          <h4>About Me</h4>
          
          <p>I am a PhD candidate/course instructor at <a href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke CS</a>, where I am advised by the amazing <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ksm/" target="_blank">Kristin Stephens-Martinez</a>. <i>Shao-Heng</i> is my first name; Shao is not.</p>

          <p>My research interest is broadly in <i>Computing/CS Education Research</i> (CER/CSEd). This includes but does NOT equal to the art of teaching computing/CS -- that puts the emphasis on the wrong people. Instead, I think of CER/CSEd as studying how to make the learning environment better for computing/CS learners. My current research seeks to quantitatively <a href="https://csed-help-seeking.github.io/csed-help-seeking" target="_blank"><i>characterize computing students' help-seeking approach, behavior, and tendencies</i></a>, with an emphasis on investigating help-seeking approach <i>across multiple help resources</i> and <i>across multiple instructional contexts</i>.</p>

          <p>Before stepping in to CER, I wandered through some very theoretical and some very empirical parts of CS. All those works fall under the umbrella of <i>algorithms for the real world</i>, where the real world included e-commerce, pricing, social networks, as well as redistricting and gerrymandering. Those are documented in <a href="publications.html">here</a>. To leverage this background, but more importantly because I care, I plan to pivot into pedagogy, learning environment design, and broadening participation in <i>non-programming-based computing contexts</i>.</p>
          
          <p>Before Duke, I worked at <a href="https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html" target="_blank">Academia Sinica</a>. Prior to that, I got my BS and MS from <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/graduate/english/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a>. I am from the tropical harbor city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaohsiung" target="_blank">Kaohsiung, Taiwan</a>. Between 1895-1945 the city was once <a href="https://youtu.be/e_UkowmQs30" target="_blank">Takao, Japan</a>. In the 17th century, it was Takau, Dutch Formosa.</p>

          <p>Outside of academics, I am a lifelong baseball fan/player (for 20+ years now). I learned most of my data science/database skills through <a href="https://www.bu.edu/dli/projects/sabermetrics-101-intro-to-baseball-analytics/">Sabermetrics 101</a> on EdX. I read <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/">baseball analytics on Fangraphs</a> daily. There used to be a whole page on my personal website about baseball. If I did not stay in the academia, I probably would have pursued a career in baseball analytics. There's a picture of me playing baseball somewhere on this page; try find it!></p>
